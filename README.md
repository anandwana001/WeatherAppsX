* di
* ui
* utils

* For animation, pre-defined AnimationUtils class is used
* Generic RecyclerView supporting list of ViewModel and DataBinding
* Custom DividerItemDecorator
* Retrieving and loading local JSON asset
* MockWebServer is used for mocking the data while doing instrumentation testing
* Separate Hilt module for testing and production
